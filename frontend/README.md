# YashveerJi Care Frontend (Vite + React)

## Environment configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Update `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to point at your backend (e.g. `http://localhost:4000`).

The app reads this value to build all API requests, so you can easily switch between local and hosted backends.
